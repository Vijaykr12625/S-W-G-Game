# Snake Water Gun Game 🎮
This is a simple Python-based Snake-Water-Gun Game, similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. The player competes against the computer, and the winner is decided based on the game rules.

# 📌Rules of the Game
Snake vs Water → Snake drinks water → Snake wins  
Water vs Gun → Gun sinks in water → Water wins  
Gun vs Snake → Gun kills snake → Gun wins  
If both choose the same option → It's a draw  

# 🛠️ How the Code Works  
1. The program uses Python’s random module to let the computer pick a choice:  
   • 1 → Snake  
   • -1 → Water  
   • 0 → Gun  
2. The user enters their choice using:  
   • s → Snake  
   • w → Water  
   • g → Gun  
3. Both choices are compared, and the winner is decided using conditional statements.  
4. The result is printed (Win/Lose/Draw).

# ▶️ Example Run  
Enter your choice : s  
you chose snake  
computer chose water  
You Win!
